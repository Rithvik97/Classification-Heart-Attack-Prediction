# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction using Classificaiton Algorithms
## Overview

This repository contains a Python Notebook that performs an analysis and prediction of heart attack occurrences using four different algorithms - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to provide insights into the factors that contribute to heart attacks and build models to identify individuals at risk.

## Project Description

The project involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Building and Evaluation

Prediction and Interpretation

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have the following software and libraries installed:

Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains various medical attributes of patients that can potentially influence heart attack occurrences. The key attributes include:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Serum Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar

Resting ECG Results

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

Exercise Induced Angina

ST Depression

Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment

Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy

Thalassemia

## Models
The following machine learning models are used in this project:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine

K-Nearest Neighbors

Each model is evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

We got 87% accuracy and 88% AUC with the Logistic Regression model.

We got 83% accuracy and 85% AUC with the Decision Tree Model.

We got 83% accuracy and 89% AUC with the Support Vector Classifier Model.

And we got 90.3% accuracy and 93% AUC with the Random Forest Classifier Model.

When all these model outputs are evaluated, we prefer the model we created with the Random Forest Algorithm, which gives the best results.
